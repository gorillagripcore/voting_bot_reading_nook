# How to use bot!
You'll need two channels in the server
### vote-input
is used to talk to the bot and set up the vote, this should be private so that the other members can't see this chat. Initialize the vote by writing "New vote"

### âœ¨-voting-âœ¨
is used for the bot to send the actual vote. Ensure that this is public but that users can't write in it or add their reactions. 

It's important that the channels are named exactly after these (If you don't intend to change the code that is!)

# What to send
I, of course, added error handling. But to make it easy for you I'll just tell you exactly what to send so that you don't have to go through the hassle of redoing the vote input over and over

When the bot says "New vote initiated. Please send the first book." You have to send the book title, the author, and a picture of the cover. [book_title, author_name] and then attaching the image to the message. 

Do exactly the same for the next book. 

For the month, you can write whatever. 

And for the emojis, it's important that you pick 2 with a space in between. (The emojis are used for the reaction buttons)



Alright, good luck ðŸ§¸
